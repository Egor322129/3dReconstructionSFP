# 3dReconstructionSFP
Reconstruction of surfaces using polarization filter and matlab

The task was to achieve surface normals to build 3d model. 
Here you can see two result images that give visualisation of parametres

-polar angle
-azimuth angle
from which then we extacted normals by integrating
