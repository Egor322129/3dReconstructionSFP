# 3dReconstructionSFP
Reconstruction of surfaces using polarization filter and matlab

The task was to achieve surface normals to build 3d model. We use polarisation filter (image below), sfp tecnology and Matlab to calculate 3d parametres of object surface. Using this method we can get 3d information from 3 shots with different polarisation angle, for example 0, 45 and 90 deegres.

The bottom images show polar angle and azimuth angle that contains sufficient information for normals estemating.
Also here is the photo of polarisation lense to better vision presentation of needed equipment
